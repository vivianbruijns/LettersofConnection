    <h2>How It All Began</h2>
    <p>Letters of Connection was founded with a simple yet powerful vision: to combat social isolation among elderly community members while providing students with valuable life lessons and perspectives from older generations. We recognized that in our increasingly digital world, the personal touch of handwritten correspondence was being lost, along with opportunities for meaningful intergenerational connections.</p>

  <section class="content-section">
    <h2>Our Impact</h2>
    <p>Since our inception, we've facilitated thousands of letter exchanges between students and elderly participants. These connections have resulted in lasting friendships, reduced feelings of loneliness, and created a valuable exchange of wisdom, experience, and fresh perspectives.</p>
