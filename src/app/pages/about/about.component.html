      <p class="section-text">To add to the learning value of this experience we recommend parents to read their letters before sending them out and provide supportive corrections. Gentle guidance can help them grow in vocabulary, grammar, and self-expression, enabling steady improvement in their literacy skills—one letter at a time. With each exchange, they gain confidence, develop their voice, and discover the joy of meaningful communication.</p>
